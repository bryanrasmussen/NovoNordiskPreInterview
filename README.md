# Dropdown select list

## Setup

in the console run npm install
when that is done do npm run start - it should open it in your browser of choice

Code has been tested in Firefox, Safari and Chrome
With Voiceover in Firefox (not great but was usable, needed improvements)

## What you should see

A Headline 'Metadatavalg' and a multiselect dropdown using the Antd component library with two option groups 2690/5 and W2489 ChA 235nm. 


## Observations 

It was said that other visualizations might be reasonable to discuss, I am of course unfamiliar with the equipment from which this data was extracted, but I would think some of the data visualizations applying to W2489 ChA found in this document http://tru.uni-sz.bg/bjvm/BJVM-September%202021%20p.355-364.pdf might be pertinent.
